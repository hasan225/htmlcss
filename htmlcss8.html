            <p class="a">A half-ghoul can either be born naturally as a ghoul and a human's offspring, or artificially created by transplanting some ghoul organs into a human.</p> <p class="b">In both cases, a half-ghoul is usually much stronger than a pure-blood ghoul. In the case of a half-ghoul, only one of the eyes undergoes the "red eye"</p> <p class="c">transformation. Natural born half-ghouls are very rare, and creating half-ghouls artificially initially has a low success rate</p>
