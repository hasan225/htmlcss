            <p>Eight hundred years ago, the world was protected by Eight Shinigami Legions, a group of dedicated to to preserving the world order. Led by the Grim Reaper himself, the group faced a betrayal by Death's own apprentice, who became a kishin and wrecked havoc on the world with his powers of insanity.

                Forced to be sealed away by his own master, the group disbanded. The Grim Reaper then founded Death Weapon Meister Academy (also by the acronym "DWMA") to act in it's place. Students within the school, enrolled as either meisters (users of demon weapons) or demon weapons (humans who can transform into weapons), are educated and supervised at a young age to prevent the uprising of another kishin while upholding the responsibility of fighting against the forces of evil and the collection of souls of the deceased.</p>
